# Spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we've developed a comprehensive data pipeline on Amazon Web Services (AWS) utilizing data extracted from kaggle dataset. The raw datasets (5 csv files) includes a wide range of artist and songs-related information which requires a lot of data cleaning (cleaned and normalised down into 3 csv files) before loading the the refined data into an AWS S3. Our focus remains on optimizing data processing while upholding security and accessibility standards within the AWS environment, enabling robust analytics and decision-making capabilities for the top spotify songs dataset and beyond.
